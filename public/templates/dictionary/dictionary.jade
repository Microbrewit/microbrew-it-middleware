	h2 Ingredients

	h3 Yeasts
	ul
		li#attenuation Attenuation: The amount of sugar processed by the yeast.
		li#fermentation Fermentation: The act of transforming starches to alcohol and CO2.
		li#flocculation Flocculation: The degree to which yeast gather into clusters and drop out of liquid.

	h4 Strains
	ul
		li#Saccharomyces-cerevisiae Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Ale yeast
		li#Saccharomyces-pastorianus Saccharomyces pastorianus: Lager yeast

	h4 Yeast byproducts
	ul
		li#Acetaldehyde Acetaldehyde: A product of alcohol metabolism that is more toxic than alcohol itself, acetaldehyde is created when the alcohol in the liver is broken down.

		#Isoamyl Acetate

	h4 Yeast taste
	ul
		li#Esters Esters provide a huge portion of yeast-derived beer flavor. They tend to come off as fruity in flavor, but each ester tastes a little different. Generally speaking, ester production is directly related to fermentation, and warmer fermentation temps increase their presence. There's many other factors at play here, especially the strain of yeast being used, but the lower fermentation temperature is why you don't encounter esters as overtly in lagers as you do in ales.

				li#Isoamyl-acetate Isoamyl acetate:
					p Taste: banana Runts
					p Aroma: sweet, fruity, banana, green, ripe  
				li#ethyl-acetate Ethyl acetate:
					p Taste: nail polish remover
					p Aroma: nail polish remover
				li#ethyl-caprylate Ethyl caprylate (Ethyl octanoate) :
					p Taste: Sweet, waxy, fruity and pineapple with creamy, fatty, mushroom and cognac notes
					p Aroma: Fruity, wine, waxy, sweet, apricot, banana, brandy, pear
				li#ethyl-hexanoate Ethyl Hexanoate (Ethyl Caproate):
					p Taste: Sweet, fruity, pineapple, waxy, fatty, green banana nuance, aniseed
					p Aroma: Sweet, fruity, pineapple, waxy, fatty, green banana nuance

		li#Phenols Phenols, which also occur in every beer, are produced not just from yeast, but also from other beer ingredients or chemicals like chlorine found in brewing water. (For example, tannins are a type of phenol present in both hops and malt). But we're talking about yeast here, and there are a couple well-known and easily-identifiable yeast-derived phenols that you'll encounter in your pint.

			ul
				li#4-vinyl-guaiacol 4-Vinyl guaiacol: is a key flavour impact character in German-style wheat beers. It imparts a distinctive clove-like note, being produced by specially selected strains of brewing yeast. In the case of other beers it is generally an off-flavour originating from wild yeasts. [Beer \& Brewing](https://beerandbrewing.com/dictionary/m5KXpWfsT2/4-vinyl-guaiacol/)

				li#4-ethyl-phenol 4-ethyl phenol: produced by the wild yeast Brettanomyces. This is the phenol people are talking about when they refer to "horse blanket" or "barnyard" character in a beer.
					p Taste: Phenolic, smoke, bacon and ham
					p Aroma: Smoke, phenolic, creosote and savory

		li#Alcohols Alcohols
			ul
				li#ethanol Ethanol imparts a warming, drying, or astringent effect on the palate. 

				li#fusel Fusel alcohols are easily generated by beer yeast, especially at elevated fermentation temperatures and with higher-ABV beers that may stress yeast. These can have a harsh effect on the palate, but they are also responsible for some pleasant floral and wine-like aromatics.

				li#Isoamyl-Alcohol Isoamyl Alcohol: It is one of several isomers of amyl alcohol. It is a main ingredient in the production of banana oil, an ester found in nature and also produced as a flavouring in industry.

				li#1-Propanol 1-Propanol: It is formed naturally in small amounts during many fermentation processes and used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry mainly for resins and cellulose esters.

		li#Ketones Ketones
			
			ul
				li#Diacetyl Diacetyl: Gives a buttery, butterscotch flavour.
				ul
					li Byproduct of fermentation (especially high temperature, high flocculation).
					li Produced by bacteria that produces lactic acid (Lactobacillus, Pediococci). 
					li Caused by fermentables with low protein levels (low level of amino-acids eucine and valine level).
					li Raunch taste caused by oxidation.
				
				li#Acetylpropionyl Acetylpropionyl, also known as acetyl propionyl or 2,3-pentanedione. Gives a buttery, cheesy, sweet, nutty, fruity, creamy, caramel

		li#americal-ale American ale yeast strain is very "clean," producing few esters or phenols. 
		li#english-ale English ale yeasts tend to express more estery character than their American cousins. They also can ferment a bit less thoroughly than American ale yeast, leaving a bit more sweetness that will emphasize the malty flavors in beer.
		li#belgian-ale Belgian ales are where yeast character really gets to shine. Traditional yeast strains produce very high levels of esters, phenols, and fusel alcohols, and leave the beer very dry, accentuating these flavors. Look for complex spice and fruit character all over these beers.
		li#german-wheat German wheat beers are another great way to taste what yeast can do. Packed with isoamyl acetate and 4-vinyl guaiacol, any traditional German wheat beer will showcase banana and clove-like ester and phenol flavors in bounds

	h3 Hops

	h4 Acids
	ul
		li#alpha-acids Alpha acids is the type of acids that contributes bitterness to a beer. The longer you boil a hop the more bitterness is released. The AA% shows the amount of alpha-acids in a hop by weight. [Read more on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_acid).
		li#beta-acids Beta acids often contribute herbal flavours. Hops contain beta acids or lupulones sensitive to oxidative decomposition which may be detrimental to the taste of beer. For this reason, beta acids are considered a negative factor in brewing and many brewers usually choose hops with a low beta acid content.

	h4 Oils
	The main components of hops essential oils are terpene hydrocarbons consisting of myrcene, humulene and caryophyllene.[29] Myrcene is responsible for the pungent smell of fresh hops. Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma. Together, myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene represent 80 to 90% of the total hops essential oil.

	ul
		li#b-pinene Beta-pinene (b-pinene or β-pinene) contributes a woody-green pine-like smell. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-Pinene)
		li#myrcene Myrcene is responsible for the pungent smell of fresh hops.
		li#caryophyllene Caryophyllene is one of the chemical compounds that contributes to the spiciness of black pepper. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryophyllene)
		li#humulene Humulene and its oxidative reaction products may give beer its prominent hop aroma. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humulene)
		li#geraniol Geraniol contributes flavors such as peach, raspberry, grapefruit, red apple, plum, lime, orange, lemon, watermelon, pineapple, and blueberry. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geraniol)

	h3 Fermentables
	ul
		li#malt Malt is germinated cereal grains that have been dried in a process known as "malting". The grains are made to germinate by soaking in water, and are then halted from germinating further by drying with hot air. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malt)
		li#lovibond "Degrees Lovibond" or "°L" scale is a measure of the colour of a substance, usually beer, whiskey, or sugar solutions. The determination of the degrees lovibond takes place by comparing the colour of the substance to a series of amber to brown glass slides, usually by a colorimeter. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beer_measurement#Colour)
		li#ppg PPG stands for Points per Pound per Gallon. PPG relates the amount of gravity points contributed by one pound in one gallon of water.
